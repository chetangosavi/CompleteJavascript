Callback Queue and Event Loop :

    Callback Queue: After an asynchronous task is complete, its callback is added to the Callback Queue. 
    The Event Loop: checks whether the Call Stack is empty and, if so, pushes callbacks from the queue to the call stack

    function printHello(){
        console.log("Hello");
    }

    function blockFor2Sec(){
        someLoop......
    }

    setTimeout(printHello,0);
    blockFor2Sec();
    console.log("Me First")
