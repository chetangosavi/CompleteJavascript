What is a Callback?
    -> A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function â€” 
       and it's usually called later, after something happens

        function greet(name, callback) {
            console.log("Hi " + name);
            callback();
            }

            function sayBye() {
            console.log("Goodbye!");
            }

            greet("Chetan", sayBye);

    Output: 
        Hi Chetan
        Goodbye!


Why Use Callbacks?
    Handling async code (like file reads, APIs)
    Running code after something else finishes
    Used in higher-order functions (like map, filter, forEach, etc)
