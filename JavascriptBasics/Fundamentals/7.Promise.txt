What is a Promise?
    -> A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) 
       of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.


        const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            // async operation
            if (/* success */) {
                resolve("Success!");
            } else {
                reject("Error occurred!");
            }
            });

            myPromise
            .then((data) => console.log(data))
            .catch((err) => console.error(err));


        States of a Promise:
            Pending – initial state
            Fulfilled – operation completed successfully (resolve)
            Rejected – operation failed (reject)
