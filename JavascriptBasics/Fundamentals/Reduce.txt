What is reduce()?
    -> reduce() is a method used on arrays in JavaScript. It reduces the array to a single value 
       by running a callback function on each element.

    array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
        return updatedAccumulator;
    }, initialValue);


    accumulator: holds the result from the previous iteration (or initial value in the first run)
    currentValue: the current element of the array
    initialValue (optional): the starting value of the accumulator
