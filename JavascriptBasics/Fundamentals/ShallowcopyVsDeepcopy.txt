 Shallow Copy:
    It copies only the top-level properties.
    If a property is a reference (like an object or array), it copies the reference, not the actual data.


Deep Copy:
    It recursively copies all levels, including nested objects/arrays.
    Both top-level and nested data are duplicated.
