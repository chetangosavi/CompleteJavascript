Asynchrinicity in js:

        Asynchrinicity is a backbone of modern developement in js

        javascript is :
            - single Threaded
            - synchronously executed
    
        so what if we have task:
            - Accessing server to get new data that takes a long time
            - code we want to run using that data

Challenge : we want to wait  for that data to be stored in data so that they are there
            to run that displayData on - but no code can run in mean time
