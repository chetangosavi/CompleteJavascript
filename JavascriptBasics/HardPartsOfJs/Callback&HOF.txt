Callback and High Order Function :

    Function in js are called first class objects
    They can co-exist with and can be treated like any other js objects
        1. Assigned to variables and properties of other js objects
        2. passed as arguments into function.
        3. Reeturned as values from function.

    What is the difference between a callback function and a higher-order function?
        - A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, while a higher-order function 
          is the function that accepts, returns, or operates on other functions, including callbacks.

    Callback Function :
        callback: A function passed as an argument, executed inside higherOrderFunction.

    Example: 
        function higherOrderFunction(callback) {
            // Perform some operations
            // Call the callback function
            callback();
            }
        function callbackFunction() {
             console.log("Callback function is executed.");
            }
        // Passing the callback function to the higher-order function
        higherOrderFunction(callbackFunction);
