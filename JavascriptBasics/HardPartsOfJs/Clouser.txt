Clouser : 

     a closure is a function that has access to the variables and parameters of its outer function, 
     even after the outer function has returned. Closures are created when a function is defined 
     within another function, and the inner function retains access to the outer function's variables.

     
    - Clouser is the most extoric of Javascript concepts
    - Enable powerful pro-level function like 'Once' and 'memoize'
    - Many JavaScript design patterns including the module pattern use Clouser
    - Build iterators, handle partial application and maintain state in an 
      asynchronous world.

      Function can be return from another function in js:

        Ex:
                function createFunction(){
                    function multiplyBy2(num){
                        return num*2;
                    }
                    return multiplyBy2;
                }

                const generateFunction = createFunction();
                const result = generateFunction(3);
                console.log(result)                        ---------------> 6


                Note - function defination is a value and it can to stored into variable
