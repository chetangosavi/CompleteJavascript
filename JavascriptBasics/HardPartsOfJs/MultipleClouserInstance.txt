function outer(){
        let counter = 0;
        function counterInc(){
            return counter++;
        }

       return counterInc
    }

    const generateFnc = outer();
    console.log(generateFnc());     - 1
    console.log(generateFnc());     - 2
    console.log(generateFnc());     - 3

    const anotherFnc = outer();
    console.log(anotherFnc());      - 1
    console.log(anotherFnc());      - 2

    if we run outer once again and store counterInc in anotherFnc this anotherFnc function is created in new execution context
    therfore it will have its own new bagpack independent of previous results
