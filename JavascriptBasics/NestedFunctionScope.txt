Nested Function scope :

    Calling Function inside the same function call as it was defined:

            Function outerFunction(){
                let counter = 0;
                function counterInc(){
                    return counter++;
                }

                counterInc();
            }

            outerFunction()

            - where you define your function determines what data it has access 
            to when you call it
