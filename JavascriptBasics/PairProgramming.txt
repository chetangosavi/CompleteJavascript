    PairProgramming :
            What is Pair Programming?
            - Pair programming is a software development practice where two programmers work 
            together on one computer. It involves one programmer, the driver, writing code while 
            the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as itâ€™s typed. This 
            real-time collaboration helps catch errors early, improves code quality through constant
            feedback, and ensures better design decisions. It also facilitates knowledge sharing and 
            reduces the likelihood of bugs, leading to more efficient problem-solving and enhanced 
            productivity within the development team.
