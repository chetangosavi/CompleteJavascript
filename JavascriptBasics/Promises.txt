Promises : A Promise is an Object that links Producing code and Consuming code.

    Promise Object Properties:
        A JavaScript Promise object can be:

        1. Pending
        2. Fulfilled
        3. Rejected
        The Promise object supports two properties: "state" and "result".
            - While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.
            - When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.
            - When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.

        What is promise all JavaScript?
        -> Promise. all is used when you have multiple asynchronous operations and you want to wait for all of them to complete.
           It takes an array of promises and returns a single Promise that resolves when all of the promises have resolved


           Ex:

                function displayData(data){
                    console.log(data)
                }

                const futureData = fetch('{API LINK HERE}')
                .then(res=>res.json())
                .then(json=>displayData(json))

                console.log("Me First")


                Output :
                            Me First
                            {
                                PromiseObject
                            }
