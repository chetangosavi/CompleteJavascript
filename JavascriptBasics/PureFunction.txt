Pure function in js :
    A Pure Function is a function (a block of code) that always returns the same result if the same arguments are passed.

    EX:
        function add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
        }
        console.log(add(2, 3)); 
        console.log(add(2, 3));


        - Pure functions return consistent results for identical inputs.
        - They do not modify external states or depend on mutable data.
        - Often used with immutable data structures to ensure reliability.
        - Their independence from external states makes them highly reusable.
