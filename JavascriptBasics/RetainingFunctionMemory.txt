Retaining Function Memory:

    function outer(){
        let counter = 0;
        function counterInc(){
            return counter++;
        }

       return counterInc
    }

    const generateFnc = outer();
    console.log(generateFnc());
    console.log(generateFnc());
    console.log(generateFnc());

    to counterInc(then to generateFnc) throw hidden property known as [[scope]]
    which persists when the inner function is returned.
