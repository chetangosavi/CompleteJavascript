Call Stack :
    JavaScript keep track of what function is currently running(Where is the thread of Execution)

    - Run a function and add it to the call stack 
                |                         |
                |   multiplyByTwo(value)  |
                |    Global Execution     |  
                ---------------------------   --> on completion it remove function from call stack

                Global Execution is always at bottom  - and which ever function is on top of the stack - is currently running

const num = 3
    funtion multiplyByTwo(value){
        const result = value*2;
        return result;
    }

    const ans = multiplyByTwo(num);
    const ans2 = multiplyByTwo(10);
