Javascript Basics : JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.
    JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich.

    When Javascript code runs it goes through the code line-by-line and execute each line known as "Thread of Execution"
    Save data like Strings and Arrays so we can use that data later in "Memory"

    Working :

    const num = 3
    funtion multiplyByTwo(value){
        const result = value*2;
        return result;
    }

    const ans = multiplyByTwo(num);
    const ans2 = multiplyByTwo(10);

    Memory :
            //Global Execution Conetxt
                {

                Line 1 - num : 3
                Line 2 - multiplyByTwo(identifier) : [ Bundled Funtion ] 
                Line 3 - output : Initially it saves only refernce bec at this point
                we dont know the calculated value 

                funtion call - Creates Execution Context is Created for the function Execution

                //Local Execution Conetxt:
                    { 
                        This also have two section 
                            ThreadOfExecution           LocalMemory  
                                Line 1                value : 3 ->(Argument)
                                                    (Parameter)
                                Line 2                 result = 6
                                return result
                                        \
                                        Checks for the result in the memory and ship it to the function call 
                    }
                    Now After function evaluation
                    output = 6   ---> actual value
                //EndOfLocal Execution

            //End of global execution Context

            
                In JavaScript we have single thread execution so it perform one task at a time


    Global Execution Context - Wraps Over All Process            
    Execution Context : Created to run the code of the function - has 2 parts
        - Thread of Execution   
        - Memory
